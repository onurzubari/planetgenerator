- [ ] Add task to todos in local notes
- [ ] Do a test build: `gradle clean build -x test`

### While Implementing
- [ ] Follow code in feature specification
- [ ] Write unit tests as you go
- [ ] Commit frequently with descriptive messages

## 📈 Metrics to Track

For each feature you implement, capture:

```markdown
## Feature: [Name]

## 🤔 Common Questions

**Q: Which feature should I do first?**
A: **Ambient Occlusion Map**. It's quick (4-6h), has huge visual impact, and no dependencies.

**Q: What if I want multiple features?**
A: Follow one of the 4 paths in FEATURE_SUMMARY.md. They're designed to work together.

**Q: Can I do these out of order?**
A: Most features are independent. See the dependency graph in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md.

**Q: How long will Phase 5 take?**
A: 2-3 weeks (Path A/B/C) to 4-5 weeks (Path D/Complete). Start with week 1 foundation tasks.

**Q: Will these break existing code?**
A: No. Design guidelines: backward-compatible, optional features, no performance regression.

**Q: Do I need new dependencies?**
A: Only for GUI (JavaFX) and glTF export (babylon.gltf-java). Everything else uses existing libraries.
